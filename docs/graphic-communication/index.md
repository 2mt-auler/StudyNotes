## Colour Wheel

![Colour Wheel](./colour-wheel.jpg)

**Primary** Colours: Red, Blue and Yellow are the three primary colours.

**Secondary** Colours: These are produced by mixing together two primary colours.

* Red + Yellow = Orange
* Blue + Red = Violet
* Yellow + Blue = Green

**Tertiary** Colours: These are produced by mixing a secondary colour with a primary colour. For example:

* Yellow + Orange = Yellowy Orange
* Red + Violet = Reddy Violet
* Blue + Green = Bluey Green

Colours which are close to or next to each other on the colour wheel are said to be in harmony because they harmonise with each other. They are harmonious.

Colours which are opposite to each other on the colour wheel are said to be complimentary. They are contrasting colours.

**Warm colours** such as reds, yellows and oranges are also known to as **Advancing colours** because they appear to be closer to the viewer than other colours. A room painted in these colours would seem warm but also feel smaller because warm colours make the walls feel closer.

**Cold colours** such as blues, greens and violets have exactly the opposite effect. They appear to be further away and are also known as **Receding colours**. A room painted in these colours would appear cold, but also feel bigger as these colours make the walls look more distant.
