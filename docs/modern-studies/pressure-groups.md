title: Pressure Groups
---
A pressure group is a group of people who join together because they feel a particular way about an issue.

The aim of a pressure group is to put pressure on a government or organisation to make changes to the law or even the introduction of new laws.

People who join pressure groups want to change things without the need to be elected.

# Examples
* Amnesty International
* Netmums
* WWF
* Greenpeace
* SSPCA
* Oxfam
* 38 Degrees
* Leave EU
* Christian Institute

# Methods used by Pressure Groups

## Petition
* Pressure groups use this method to show how strongly that they feel around a specific issue. <br />

**Example:**<br />
Snowdrop Campaign - They gained 750,000 signatures and they were able to ban private ownership of handguns after the Dunblane shooting in 1996.

## Publicity Stunts
Some pressure groups make use of publicity stunts in front of landmarks. Sometimes the protestors do illegal things in order to be noticed by the government.

**Example**<br />
Greenpeace climbed up a building as a publicity stunt.
