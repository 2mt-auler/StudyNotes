# Media

**Newspapers** can tell people how to vote. For example: The Sun has backed the party that has gone onto win every general election scince 1980.

**TV** has to be impartial by law. However, there was some evidence that TV news was balanced but biased in it's coverage of the Scottish Independence referendum campaigns.

**Social Media** is increasingly being used by political parties to campaign. For example: Jeremy Corbyn uses it successfully to reach young Labour votors.

# Pressure Groups

Pressure groups promote a cause -> raises awareness amongst public -> government takes action.

For example: Greenpeace + other enviromental groups campaigned against fracking + the Scottish Government has banned fracking.

# Insider Groups

Insider groups are listened to by the government. 

For example: The British Medican Assosiation (BMA) have influenced the government to tackle smoking (ban on smoking in public places, smoking in cars with children)

# Outsider Groups

Outsider groups are not close to the government so they use ore extreme methods such as petitions, protest marches and demonstations.

For example: Fathers for Justice climbed famous buildings dressed as superheros to highlight issues around father's rights. However, they did not have much influence.
