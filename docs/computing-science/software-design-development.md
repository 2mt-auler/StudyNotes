# Input, Process and Output

Most peices of software ask the user for an input, then the software does some proccessing and it will output that data. An example is below:

**Input**
* Length
* Width
* Height

**Process**
* Volume = Length * Width * Height

**Output**
* Volume

# Pseudocode

Pseudocode for the above example would look something like this.

```

Length = user input(float)
Width = user input(float)
Height = user input(float)

Volume = Length * Width * Height

Display "Volume = " and Volume and "m3"

```
